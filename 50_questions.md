# üêö Top 50 Shell Scripting Interview Questions and Answers for DevOps Engineers

## üìò Basics

1. **What is a shell? How is it different from a terminal?**  
   A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing the operating system's services. A terminal is an interface that lets you interact with the shell.

2. **How do you write and execute a basic shell script?**  
   Create a file with `.sh` extension, add `#!/bin/bash` at the top, write commands, then run:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ./script.sh
   ```

3. **What is the difference between `sh` and `bash`?**  
   `sh` is the Bourne shell; `bash` is the Bourne Again Shell with more features like arrays, `[[ ]]`, improved scripting constructs.

4. **How do you pass arguments to a shell script?**  
   ```bash
   ./script.sh arg1 arg2
   echo $1 $2
   ```

5. **Explain the meaning of `$0`, `$1`, `$@`, `$*`, and `$#`.**  
   - `$0`: Script name  
   - `$1`, `$2`...: Positional parameters  
   - `$@`: All arguments as separate strings  
   - `$*`: All arguments as a single string  
   - `$#`: Number of arguments

6. **What are environment variables? How do you access them?**  
   Key-value pairs in the environment. Access with `$VAR_NAME`, set with `export VAR=value`.

7. **What does `#!/bin/bash` do?**  
   It's a shebang that tells the system to use Bash to interpret the script.

8. **How do you make a script executable?**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

9. **What‚Äôs the difference between `source script.sh` and `./script.sh`?**  
   `source` runs the script in the current shell. `./` runs it in a new subshell.

10. **How do you read user input in a shell script?**  
    ```bash
    read -p "Enter your name: " name
    echo "Hello, $name"
    ```

## üîÅ Flow Control

11. **How do you write `if-else` and `case` statements in bash?**  
    ```bash
    if [ $a -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Positive"
    else
      echo "Negative"
    fi
    ```

    ```bash
    case $var in
      1) echo "One";;
      2) echo "Two";;
      *) echo "Other";;
    esac
    ```

12. **What‚Äôs the difference between `[` and `[[` in conditionals?**  
    `[[` is more powerful and safer (supports pattern matching, no pathname expansion).

13. **How do you use `&&` and `||` in condition checking?**  
    - `cmd1 && cmd2`: cmd2 runs only if cmd1 succeeds.  
    - `cmd1 || cmd2`: cmd2 runs only if cmd1 fails.

14. **Explain the use of `while`, `for`, and `until` loops in shell scripts.**  
    ```bash
    for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done
    while [ $x -lt 5 ]; do ((x++)); done
    until [ $x -ge 5 ]; do ((x++)); done
    ```

15. **How do you break out of a loop or skip iterations?**  
    - `break`: exits the loop  
    - `continue`: skips to the next iteration

## üî® Script Functions & Operations

16. **How do you define and call functions in a shell script?**  
    ```bash
    function greet() { echo "Hello $1"; }
    greet World
    ```

17. **How do you return values from a function?**  
    Use `return` for numeric exit codes or `echo` for strings:
    ```bash
    function get_name() { echo "DevOps"; }
    name=$(get_name)
    ```

18. **What are exit codes and how do you use them?**  
    `0` = success, other numbers = errors. Access last exit code via `$?`.

19. **What is the significance of `set -e`, `set -u`, and `set -x`?**  
    - `set -e`: Exit on error  
    - `set -u`: Error on unset variables  
    - `set -x`: Print each command before executing

20. **How do you handle errors in bash scripts?**  
    Use `trap`, `set -e`, conditional checks, and logging.
